If you want to run **docassemble** to test it out, you should download
and run it [using Docker].  You can also create a "no code"
**docassemble** interview for free at [Community.lawyer](https://community.lawyer/) or [Documate](https://www.documate.org).

If you want to [deploy] **docassemble** in the cloud, you can run it
[using Docker] on a cloud-based virtual machine.

If you are interested in looking at the source code of
**docassemble**, you can clone the [GitHub repository]:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone {{ site.github.clone_url }}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also download the repository as a [tarball] or a [ZIP file].

The [Python] packages of **docassemble** are also available on [PyPI]:

{% highlight bash %}
pip install docassemble.webapp
{% endhighlight %}

See the [Change Log] for a description of recent updates.

The **docassemble** web application requires more than just its
[Python] packages to run.  (This is why [using Docker] is
recommended.)  For details of how **docassemble** works, see the
[installation] section.
